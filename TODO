VM:

 - Start in Recovery mode (done)
Storage:

Other:
  - Install last patchs
  - New Storage -> Hardware HBA (done)
  - Send Ctrl alt del
  - Clean code
GUI:
  - Transition to GTK3
  - Make GUI Elements use native colour coding. (Ex. window_newvm.glade, storage.glade)
  - I disabled the 'eventnewstg0' modify_bg colouring of which step of the new storage creation.
    This glade file is a complete mess and I'll have to reimplement this. Maybe I can find some consistant method to do this.
	Crash when I modified the layout of this dialog:
		Traceback (most recent call last):
		File "./src/OXM/window_menuitem.py", line 928, in on_menuitem_stg_new_activate
		self.builder.get_object("eventnewstg0").modify_bg(gtk.STATE_NORMAL, blue)
		AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'modify_bg'
