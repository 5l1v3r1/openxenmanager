There has to be a better way:
	OXM/window_properties.py   line 953


Nasty alert dialog:

	Alert Dialog 'walert' definied in file 'warning_dialogs.glade' has some 
	fuckery:
	
	window.py:1562 - def show_error_dlg(self, error_string, error_title="Error"):

	It is definied as a Popup Window Type. This is so it is on top of modal
	windows. Why not just use a default message box?


New Storage Repo: storage.glade
	Windows File Server* 	-	Under the server options the checkbox 
	doesn't disable/enable the login information frame. The controls are 
	always enabled.

General: 
	treemgmtinterfaces (in mgmt_interfaces.glade) - The entries put into 
	this box wont resize this box. This also looks to be a problem in the 
	general properties dialog.
