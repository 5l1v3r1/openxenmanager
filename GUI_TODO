Make sure we're all good to use the image images/synchronize.png
	It was made by this guy: https://www.iconfinder.com/CarloRodriguez
	The license is: License: Free for commercial use

Icons:
	It'd be nice to revamp the icons. There are a ton of free with only link-back for commercial use on iconfinder.com
	A lot of people create big collections of icons which are consistant.
	Not saying to do away with the built in ones for GTK, as they would change with the persons icon set, but for some
	specialized ones, it may be nice to look at. Give the program a revamped sort of feel.



There has to be a better way:
	OXM/window_properties.py   line 953


Nasty alert dialog:

	Alert Dialog 'walert' definied in file 'warning_dialogs.glade' has some 
	fuckery:
	
	window.py:1562 - def show_error_dlg(self, error_string, error_title="Error"):

	It is definied as a Popup Window Type. This is so it is on top of modal
	windows. Why not just use a default message box?


New Storage Repo: storage.glade
	Windows File Server* 	-	Under the server options the checkbox 
	doesn't disable/enable the login information frame. The controls are 
	always enabled.

General: 
	treemgmtinterfaces (in mgmt_interfaces.glade) - The entries put into 
	this box wont resize this box. This also looks to be a problem in the 
	general properties dialog. 

Guest_network.glade
	- Have a checkbox enabling QoS
	- Edit/New net interface autoselect a valid network entry on dialog show
