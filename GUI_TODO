Nasty alert dialog:
	Alert Dialog 'walert' definied in file 'warning_dialogs.glade' has some fuckery:
	
	window.py:1562 - def show_error_dlg(self, error_string, error_title="Error"):

	It is definied as a Popup Window Type. This is so it is on top of modal windows.
	Why not just use a default message box?
